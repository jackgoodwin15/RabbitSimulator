# Rabbit Simulator Sprint Records


## Monday Afternoon- Scrum master: James




## Tuesday Morning - Scrum Master: Emese


### 9am morning stand-up: 

* make sprints longer

* set up gitHub yesterday -> create branches for everyone

* apply a more TDD approach 

* have a more clear definition of done at the end of the sprints

### 1st sprint (9:20 - 10:20):

Goals: 

* use git -(everyone)

* add main/field/world class - (Tyler, Emese)

* Run tests on what we have done so far (rabbit class) and see if it works

* merge the rabbit counter classes 

Sprint: 

* use git (blocker)  - issue: we don't know how to merge branches

* field class added - on Tyler's branch

* Tests run ( works on Tyler's branch) 

* Thanu and James reviewed the tests we have so far and added new ones

* merge the rabbit counter classes - due to blockers with git, moved this to next sprint
